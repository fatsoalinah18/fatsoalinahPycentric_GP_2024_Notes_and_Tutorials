 # Python Notes
- Python is case-sensitive.
- It uses snake case.

 ## Data types
 - Integers **(int)**
 - String **(str)**
 - Float -**float**
 - Boolean **(bool)**

> - Using the '+' operator with strings is known as __concatenation__.
> - Data conversion assists with data quality issues.
> 

## input()
 - **input()** - Used to receive input from user.
 - Always collects data as a string by default.

## print()
- **print** - Used to display output.

## type()
- **type()** - an instruction used to check the data type stored in a variable.
~~~
x = "18"
print(type(x))
~~~
### Output
~~~
<class 'str'>
~~~

# Explicit conversions
These are performed by an instruction given by a programmer.

## 1. int()
-  **int()** - an instruction that converts any type of value into an integer.
~~~
x = "18"
print(type(x))
y = int(x)
print(type(y))
~~~

### Output
~~~
<class 'str'>
<class 'int'>
~~~

## 2. float()
- __float()__ - an instruction that converts any type of value into a float.
~~~
x = "18"
print(type(x))
y = float(x)
print(type(y))
~~~
### Output
~~~
<class 'str'>
<class 'float'>
~~~
## 3. str()
- **str()** - an instruction that converts any type of value into a string.
~~~
x = 18
print(type(x))
y = str(x)
print(type(y))
~~~
### Output
~~~
<class 'int'>
<class 'str'>
~~~

# Implicit conversion
These are performed by an instruction given by the computer.

### Example
~~~
x = 5
y = 2
z = x/y  #float - implicit conversion
print(z)
~~~

### Output
~~~
2.5
~~~
# Comparison operator
**Comparison operations** - Key to the development of computer programs.

- The result of a comparison operation in Python is either **True** or **False.**
> Both the "__and__" and "**or**" operators are in lowercase.
>
>
## "and" operator
- T **and** T = T
- Every other combination = F

## "or" operator
- F **or** F = F
- Any combination with T = T

# Control flow
### Sequences
The computer runs your code in order, from top to bottom.

### Iterations
- Executing an instruction repeatedly. 
- Iteration is commonly represented as a __loop__.
- Iteration is used to automate tasks that need to be done over and over again.
- Iteration makes your programs simpler, faster and reduces errors.

_Example: Putting your favorite song on repeat._

### Selections

- Specifies when to follow each path.

_Example: Smartwatches notify the wearer if their heart rate goes outside the normal range ._

~~~
Real computer programs perform complex tasks by combining the 3 techniques.
~~~
### if-else statements
### elif (else if)


## Algorithms
- __Algorithm__ is a set of step-by-step instructions to complete a task, placed in a certain order.
### Ways to represent an algorithm

- **Pseudocode** is a simplified language that is a bit closer to a programming language. It is not specific to one programming language.
~~~
start
repeat until authorized = true
  INPUT log_in
access_granted = true
~~~
- **Flowcharts** help to visualize algorithms.

# Loops
## for loop
- A **for** loop is used to execute the same instruction over and over again, a specific number of times.

### Example:
~~~|
for i in range(3):
print("Hi Tshego.")
~~~
### Output
~~~
Hi Tshego.
Hi Tshego.
Hi Tshego.
~~~
- **Indentation** is the spaces at the beginning of lines.

The code you want to display in a for loop, i.e. your print() statement, should be indented in python.

- To signal the start of the iteration block, the initial loop statement must be followed by a **colon**.

**NB: In general, use _for_ loops when the number of iterations is known.**

## While loop

- They can be used even when you donâ€™t know how many iterations will be needed.
- **While** loops  repeat code whilst a condition holds true.
- A **counter** is a variable that keeps track of the number of iterations.
- An infinite loop is possible with this loop and counters help avoid them.

~~~
seats = 300  
while seats > 0: 
  print("Sell ticket") 
seats = seats - 1 #counter
~~~

**NB: In general, use _While_ loops when there is a condition that needs to be met.**

**NOTE**
~~~
Calculations with <,> results to boolean data type.
~~~

# Collections
- **Lists** are ordered collections of items. 
- **Lists** allow you to store a collection of multiple values in a single variable.
- They can store any data type.
- You can access an item in a list using its position or **index number.**
~~~
cart = ["milk", "tea", "jam"]
~~~

## Slicing
- **Slicing** allows you to extract a portion of a list. Starting and stopping indexes are separated by a **colon**.
- The starting index is inclusive and the stopping index is exclusive.

### Example
~~~
animals =['dog', 'cat', 'bird', 'cow'] 
print(animals[:1]) 
<!-- Omitting the starting index means slicing from the first element. -->
~~~
### Output
~~~
['dog']
~~~
